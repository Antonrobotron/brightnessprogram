brightness is a simple program I made because I didn't want to bother with finding a brightness command I enjoyed using on arch linux. 
the code may be a bit messy, but it should be simple enough to understand.

How do I use this program on my Arch distro?
Simple! go into the file and change the paths for MAXBRIGHT and BRIGHTNESS to where your maximum brightness and brightness files are located, and then compile with your C compiler. 
If you don't have a C compiler, gcc is a free and easy one to use.
